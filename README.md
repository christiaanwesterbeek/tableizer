tableizer
=========

A client side solution that let's you format and transpose tabular data that you might copy from Excel or Google Spreadsheet and to paste in an email.

It's inspired by [tableizer.journalistopia.com](http://tableizer.journalistopia.com). I didn't like the fact that it's a server side solution and I often need to drag columns, delete them or tranpose the whole thing.

#Features#
- pure javascript
- transpose
- drag/reorder columns
- delete columns
